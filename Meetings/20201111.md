Introduction of company and project.\
No previous work of this type at TetraPak. Images obtained is raw-format from master thesis made by Linnea Bj√∂rn.

Pre-processing of data? Crop to manageable size (e.g. 1000x1000? quite large still.), find regions of interest (manually?). Work with symmetry planes: not always appliable. Sometimes two symmetry-planes, sometimes one, sometime none.

Database: generate new data and manipulate in order to train network? Obtain data from Tetrapak or other organization? If not given a large dataset, statistical learning might be the approach to choose over ML. Perhaps there's data online.

Meetings with Eskil, every Wednesday (prelimiary). If nothing to discuss, omit meeting.

## IDEAS
GAN to create images: might be too excessive for this work. If given data, create net to reconstruct images based on training data. However, might not generalize for other material properties, different sample sizes and q-measures. Statistical learning might be the way (wihu).

Apply pipeline given in main research paper? Need of preproccessing to exclude bad pixel values.
