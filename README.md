# TetraPak project - AI and ML healing of the X-ray images
MVE385 - Project course in mathematical and statistical modelling

## Introduction
Background:\
Tetra  Pak®  have  started  to  use  the  experimental  techniques:  Small  and  Wide  Angle  X-ray Scattering  (SAXS  and  WAXS)  at  several  different  length  scales  in  both  laboratory  and  synchrotron X-ray sources to study the structure and material orientation of semicrystalline polymers used in polymer tops and opening devices.

Scope:\
The purpose of the student project work is to evaluate if it is possible to use Image analysis, AI and/or machine learning to heal such scattering plots, described above, in an automatic or semi-automatic  manner to enhance the interpretation and facilitate the post  processing  and  analysis of the information available and possible to extract from the scattering pattern.

Outcome: \
The goal is to develop an automatic procedure for “image” healing utilizing “intelligence” and symmetry etc. to enhance the scattering patterns from SAXS/WAXS measurements.

Methods:\
Deep Image Prior. Original work: https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior.

## Get started
### Dependencies
To run the code, some packages are needed. You can create a conda environment with the required dependencies by running
`conda env create -f environment.yml`.
